## Description
The application will allow a user to post a project he/she has created and get it reviewed by his/her peers. A projecr is divided into 3 categories i.e Design, Usability and Content. These categories can be reviewed on a scale of 1-10 and the average score is taken.

## User Stories

# As a user I would like to:
1. Users/visitors can view posted projects and their details.
2. A user has to be authenticated to post a project or a review
3. A project posting should contain the title of the project, image of the project's landing page, a detailed description of the project, link to the project on github and the deployed link.
4. Projects posted can be divided into categories.
5. A user registered in the application should have a profile page with a contact form to reach them.
6. A user can search for projects using the title.
